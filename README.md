Horizontal Mailchimp Signup Form
============

Mailchimp’s default code doesn’t create an in-line (Horizontal) signup form for you from the get-go. You have to play around with the code to get it to do so. Realistically, not everyone knows how to do that. But there's no longer a need to spend hours figuring out how to get it to do so for your website or blog. Copy and paste this html and css wherever you want, tweak whatever CSS you want to make it lovely and boom — all set.

You have yourself a horizontal (in-line) signup form.

###All we ask is:###
- If you absolutely dig this, use it, or think others will benefit from it, please give this a star and/or share.
- Replace the mailing list URL that is currently in place, with your own. Although we’d love all of your subscribers, we don’t know if they’ll love us and truthfully we don’t want to confuse them.
- You can get your mailing list URL by going to Mailchimp Lists > Embeddable forms > then look in the code snippet for the section that starts with `<form action=` and copy that whole part and replace. 

**Friends who Code:** If you have a more efficient and cleaner solution to the code, be sure to make a pull request and we’ll merge them.
