Horizontal Mailchimp Signup Form
============

Mailchimp’s default code doesn’t create an in-line (Horizontal) signup form for you from the get-go. You have to play around with the code to get it to do so. Realistically, not everyone knows how to do that. But there's no longer a need to spend hours figuring out how to get it to do so for your website or blog. Copy and paste this html and css wherever you want, tweak whatever CSS you want to make it lovely and boom — all set.

You have yourself a horizontal (in-line) signup form.

###All we ask is:###
- Replace the mailing list URL that is currently in place, with your own. Although I’d love all of your subscribers, I don’t know if they’ll love me and we don’t want to confuse them.
- If you absolutely dig this, use it, or think others will benefit from it, please give this a share.

**Friends who Code:** If you have a more efficient and cleaner solution to the code, be sure to create a Pull Request and we’ll make any changes necessary.
